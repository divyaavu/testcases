# # Selenium Test Automation Practice

This repository contains Selenium automation scripts created during my early learning phase (around 2021–2022).  
The test cases cover multiple scenarios across popular websites, including:
- Element locators and XPath strategies  
- Handling alerts, dropdowns, and dynamic tables  
- Window handling and switching between tabs  
- Waits and synchronization techniques  
- Mouse and keyboard interactions using Actions class  

**Tech Stack:**
- Java
- Selenium WebDriver
- TestNG / JUnit
- Maven

These scripts were created to strengthen hands-on knowledge in Selenium automation and framework fundamentals.
